description: MIT/Sloan Foundation Industry System Study prepared by the course professor.  The
  names of organizations and individuals have been masked for confidentiality while
  the draft is under review. This is not for circulation or distribution in any form
  ? it is only for pilot use at MIT for educational, feedback and assessment purposes.
  The study neither represents what is purely ?best? or ?worst? practice ? it is a
  presentation of complex system realities in order to help deepen understanding of
  these issues.
